<h1>Wordpress Deployment </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of hosting a wordpress website on AWS. An EC2 instance was launched. A domain name was created for my wordpress website on square space. On terminal, I logged into the server and installed all the neccessary packages that allowed me to run web applications on top of it. Wordpress website was then installed on my local system and then associated with the EC2 instance that I launched. The database was then setup and the Web server was configured. Then in a web browser using the domain name I created, the install was finished using the information I created in the setup before.

<h2>What I learned </h2>
